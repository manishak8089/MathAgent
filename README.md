# ðŸ§® Maths Agent

Maths Agent is an intelligent assistant designed to **answer math queries for students**.  
Unlike traditional LLM-based agents, this project ensures that **all calculations are handled by tools** (not the LLM).  
The LLM is responsible only for **decision-making and context understanding**, while mathematical operations are executed deterministically through MCP tools.
